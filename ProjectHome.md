# Introduction #
The main goal of the project was to make an extra access control tag so that I could still enter the office even after forgetting my original tag.

The project was split up in two main parts:
  * Making an RFID-reader so that I could evaluate how the original tag works.
  * Creating a copy of the original tag and evaluate it with my home made reader.
