== Design info ==
I based my design on [http://micah.navi.cx/2008/09/using-an-avr-as-an-rfid-tag/ Micah's tag], which is a very basic tag.  I had to make some improvements because the reader at the office has a very limited reading range.  Even my own home made reader performs better.  After trying some coils of Coilcraft, I finally stumbled on the [http://www.ti.com/rfid/ RFID inlays of TI].  These 134.2kHz-tags have coils that were just what I needed.  So I ordered such a tag, cut loose the transponder and soldered my own transponder to it.  It worked!
The tag has just the perfect size for one of the company's numerous gadgets.  So now a have a miniature LED-light and a second tag all in one.
